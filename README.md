#LineBreak

A simple program to add line breaks into lines of text.

Originally created to work with Kirikiri scripts since the engine has no auto-reline
capabilities, but this version can be used with any similar file structure.

The config.json file controls the important variables in the program, you just
need to edit the values in that file and run the program.

For simplicity, it requires a directory and will add line breaks to every file of the
set type in that directory.

The finished files are sent to an output directory.
